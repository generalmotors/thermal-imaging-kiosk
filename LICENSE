2.2	License Restrictions.  Developer agrees that the License granted in Section 2.1 above, in addition to any other limitations set forth in this Agreement, is subject to the following limitations:

(i)	Developer’s right to use the FLIR SDK is for purposes of developing, implementing and using Apps solely in conjunction with a Device or for manipulating images and data created by a Device.  Developer shall not use the FLIR SDK for any other purpose.  Developer may not use the FLIR SDK to create Apps for use with non-FLIR thermal imaging devices.  Developer shall not undertake, develop or distribute any Apps or otherwise make any other product, service or other content available through its Apps the use of which, either standing alone or in conjunction with any other software, systems, networks or data, contain functionality that could be used with non-FLIR thermal imaging products, as a direct competitor to a product, products, or apps sold by FLIR, for inappropriate or improper purposes, or for the purpose of interfering with the proper operation of, degrading, causing damage to, or otherwise adversely affecting the operation of any FLIR or third party software, hardware, services, systems, networks, or data. Developer may not copy the FLIR Software or any portion thereof except as permitted herein; provided that, Developer may make a single unmodified copy of the FLIR Software for back-up and/or archival purposes.  Developer shall not alter, obscure or remove any copyright notices or any other ownership or proprietary rights notices placed on or contained in the FLIR SDK, or any part thereof. The FLIR SDK is licensed and not sold.  All rights not expressly granted to Developer under the License are reserved by FLIR, and Developer shall not take or permit any third party to take any action with respect to the FLIR SDK that is not expressly authorized under this Agreement.    
(ii)	Developer shall not rent, lease, transfer, sublicense, sell, assign, timeshare or pledge the FLIR SDK, or any portion thereof, to any third party whether on a temporary or permanent basis, or allow any third party to access or use the FLIR SDK for any purpose, without the prior written approval of FLIR.  In particular, the FLIR SDK remains the property of FLIR, returnable upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement or upon FLIR’s earlier written request.  Developer shall not, either directly or indirectly, reverse engineer, translate, modify, alter, decompile, create derivates of or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the FLIR SDK, other than as expressly authorized in this Agreement. Developer may permit third party contractors acting on its behalf and under its supervision to use the FLIR SDK for the purposes authorized hereunder; however, Developer shall remain responsible for all acts and omissions of its contractor(s), including without limitation, any unauthorized use of the FLIR SDK by any such contractor.  A breach by Developer’s contractor of the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement by Developer.

(iii)	Developer shall not use, combine, incorporate, or otherwise link or distribute the FLIR SDK, or any part thereof, whether in connection with an App or otherwise, with any Open Source Code licensed under any terms that: (a) impose or could impose a requirement or condition that the FLIR SDK, or any part thereof: (1) be disclosed or distributed in source code form; (2) be licensed for the purpose of making modifications or derivative works; or (3) be redistributable at no charge; or (b) otherwise impose or could impose any other material limitation, restriction, or condition on the right or ability of FLIR, its licensors, successors, and assigns, to use or distribute the FLIR SDK, or any part thereof.  

3.	USE OF THE FLIR SDK.  Developer acknowledges and agrees that Developer shall be responsible for all use of the FLIR SDK by Developer hereunder.  In particular: 

3.1	Developer shall use the FLIR SDK only as authorized in this Agreement and as described in the FLIR Documentation. All use of the FLIR SDK by Developer hereunder shall strictly comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and all Apps developed by Developer hereunder and the intended use for such Apps shall strictly comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Except as provided for in the EST Addendum to this Agreement. the FLIR SDK may not be used in conjunction with any Apps designed for medical or health-related purpose.

3.2	Developer’s Apps and any products, services or content made available through such Apps shall not contain any: (i) virus, Trojan horse, worm, backdoor, shutdown mechanism, malicious code, sniffer, bot, drop dead mechanism, or spyware; or (ii) any other software, code, or program that is likely to or is intended to: (a) have an adverse impact on the performance of; (b) disable, corrupt, or cause damage to; or (c) cause or facilitate unauthorized access to or deny authorized access to, or cause to be used for any unauthorized or inappropriate purpose, any software, hardware, network, services, systems or data (collectively, “Malware”).  Developer shall inform FLIR of any Malware affecting its Apps of which Developer becomes aware.   

4.	USE OF THE FLIR APIs.  

4.1	Approval by FLIR.  Developer acknowledges and agrees that the use of FLIR APIs included as part of the FLIR SDK require the pre-approval and/or pre-authorization of FLIR as set forth in the FLIR Documentation.  Developer shall seek such approval in writing and shall provide information concerning its request as reasonably requested by FLIR.  FLIR reserves the right to refuse to approve certain uses of the FLIR APIs and/or withdraw such approval, at any time in its sole and absolute discretion.

4.2	Availability.  FLIR shall host the FLIR APIs on its computer servers and shall use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure the availability of the FLIR APIs on an uninterrupted basis.  However, FLIR does not guarantee that the availability of the FLIR APIs will be uninterrupted or that the operation of the FLIR APIs will be error-free, and Developer acknowledges and agrees that the FLIR APIs may at times be unavailable as a result of, among other things, maintenance, changes, or outages.  FLIR shall have no liability to Developer or any of its End Users with respect to the unavailability of any FLIR APIs. FLIR may change or modify the FLIR APIs at any time in its sole discretion.  FLIR shall, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, provide Developer reasonable advance notice of any changes or modifications to the FLIR APIs.   FLIR is under no obligation to support the FLIR SDK or to otherwise provide Developer any Standard Releases for the FLIR SDK.  However, if FLIR does provide Developer with any such Standard Releases, such Standard Releases shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation, the License, or such other agreement, if any, which accompanies such Standard Release. In the event FLIR does provide Developer a Standard Release, Developer shall promptly accept and implement such Standard Release within thirty (30) days of its release by FLIR.

5.	APPROVAL, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION OF APPS.

5.1	Approval by FLIR.  Developer acknowledges and agrees that all Apps developed by Developer hereunder that use the FLIR SDK or FLIR APIs shall, prior to the Apps’ distribution or licensing by Developer to end users, be expressly approved by FLIR and/or FLIR delegates.  Developer shall submit all Apps to FLIR for approval prior to making them publicly available in any way. FLIR shall review the App and, at FLIR’s sole discretion, either approve or reject the submitted App in a reasonable amount of time.  FLIR shall have no liability to Developer if an App is rejected.  Developer represents, warrants and covenants to FLIR that the App distributed and/or licensed by Developer is the identical App which was approved by FLIR and, if applicable the appropriate App hosting service (e.g. App Store and Google Play).  Notwithstanding this Section, the approval of an App by FLIR does not relieve or otherwise excuse Developer of its obligations and responsibilities with respect to the use of the FLIR SDK as set forth in this Agreement, and FLIR reserves the right to reject any App at any time, regardless of whether such App was previously approved by FLIR, should the App at any time violate conditions of this Agreement.  In the event FLIR withdraws its approval of a previously approved App, FLIR will notify Developer of such withdrawal in writing (the “Withdrawal Notice”).  Within five (5) days of the Withdrawal Notice, Developer shall respond to notify FLIR of its intent to either remedy the violation to FLIR’s satisfaction or remove the App from all public App markets and terminate any then- current License Agreements (defined below) with its End Users. Developer will provide written confirmation to FLIR within thirty (30) days that Developer has taken the actions required in this Section.  FLIR shall have no liability to Developer and/or to any of its End Users with respect to FLIR’s withdrawal of its approval of an App.  If Developer creates an App as a (non-diagnostic) tool to screen individuals for elevated skin temperatures, FLIR’s review and approval is still a requirement for public or private distribution of App. This review may, among other things, confirm that App will not function with cameras other than FLIR EST Cameras or other non-qualified hardware (see EST Addendum ) but it will not include an assessment of App’s effectiveness in measuring elevating skin temperatures.  Developer assumes all responsibility for the combined hardware and software solution’s compliance with governing regulatory agencies everywhere that the App will be distributed and will obtain certification as required

5.2	Distribution of Apps.  Developer shall enter into a license agreement (“License Agreement”) with each End User to whom it licenses and/or distributes an App.  At a minimum, such License Agreement shall include terms which: (i) restrict the use of the Apps to legal, non-tortious uses; (ii) release and hold harmless FLIR for any and all liability in connection with an End User’s use of the Apps; (iii) limit any liability of FLIR in connection with an End User’s use of the Apps in accordance with the exclusions and limitations of liability set forth below; and (iv) permit the termination of the License Agreement with reasonable written notice in the event FLIR withdraws its approval of the App pursuant to this Section, or the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

5.3	Trademarks.  FLIR may require Apps created using the SDK to display the FLIR logo (the “Logo”) by default.  When displaying the FLIR Logo, the Logo must be displayed in the same manner in which the functionality of the FLIR SDK causes the Logo to be displayed, and Developer agrees not to modify, alter, cut-apart, or otherwise distort the Logo in any way.  FLIR hereby grants to Developer, during the term and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, a limited, terminable, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferrable, royalty-free license to display the Logo as part of any App, but only in the manner in which the functionality of the FLIR SDK causes the Logo to be displayed on such Images.  FLIR reserves the right to monitor and approve all use of the Logo by Developer hereunder, as determined by FLIR in its sole and absolute discretion.  Other than as expressly set forth in this Section, no other right, title or interest is granted by FLIR in the Logo, or in any other FLIR trademarks, service marks, designs, or logos, and Developer shall not use the Logo or any other FLIR trademarks, service marks, designs, or logos except as expressly authorized by this Agreement.     
 
6.	CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  

6.1	Confidential Information Defined. 
 
(i)	For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means: (a) all nonpublic or proprietary business, commercial and technical information of FLIR, whether in written or verbal form; (b) all information designated (whether marked or unmarked) by FLIR as confidential or proprietary; and (c) all other information provided to FLIR by third parties which FLIR is obligated to keep confidential.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, FLIR’s Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, the FLIR Software, the FLIR Documentation, and all other non-public elements of the FLIR SDK and other non-public information regarding its use and functionality.  Confidential Information shall remain the sole and exclusive property of FLIR.

(ii)	Confidential Information does not include information that Developer can document to FLIR’s reasonable satisfaction: (a) was generally known to the public at the time of disclosure by FLIR; (b) became generally known to the public other than through a breach of this Agreement by Developer after the time of disclosure to Developer by FLIR; (c) was in Developer’s possession, free of any obligation of confidentiality at the time of disclosure to Developer by FLIR; (d) was rightfully received by Developer from a third party, free of any obligation of confidentiality after disclosure by FLIR to Developer; or (e) was independently developed by Developer without reference to, or use of, Confidential Information disclosed by FLIR or by otherwise breaching any provision of this Agreement. 

6.2	Use and Disclosure of Confidential Information. 

(i)	Absent the prior written consent of FLIR (which it may or may not give in its discretion), Developer agrees that for a period of seven (7) years from the termination or expiration of this Agreement, Developer: (a) will not use FLIR’s Confidential Information for any purpose other than in connection with the License; (b) will not disclose, give access to, or otherwise distribute any of FLIR’s Confidential Information to any third party, including, but not limited to, any of Developer’s Affiliates; and (c) except as otherwise expressly permitted by a provision in this Agreement, will not copy or otherwise reproduce any of FLIR’s Confidential Information.  Developer will take reasonable security precautions (at least as protective as the precautions it takes to preserve its own Confidential Information of a similar nature) to keep FLIR’s Confidential Information confidential.

(ii)	Developer will restrict the possession, knowledge and use of any of FLIR’s Confidential Information only to those of Developer’s officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents and Affiliates (“Disclosees”) who have a bona fide “need to know” the specific Confidential Information and only in connection with the License.  Developer will ensure that it has executed and maintains appropriate written agreements with its Disclosees sufficient to restrict such Disclosees’ use, disclosure, and distribution of the Confidential Information consistent with Developer’s obligations under this Agreement.  Developer will ensure that its Disclosees comply with this Agreement and their respective nondisclosure agreements, and Developer agrees to be responsible for any improper use or disclosure of Confidential Information by any such individual or entity. Developer will notify FLIR immediately upon: (a) discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of any Confidential Information; or (b) any breach of this Section by Developer or any Disclosee, and in either event, Developer will cooperate with FLIR in every reasonable way, at Developer’s expense to help FLIR regain possession of such Confidential Information and prevent further unauthorized use or disclosure.  At FLIR’s request, at any time and from time to time, Developer will: (1) promptly return all originals, copies, reproductions and summaries of FLIR’s Confidential Information; or (2) at FLIR’s option and request, destroy the same and provide written certification by an officer of destruction to FLIR.

(iii)	Developer may reasonably disclose Confidential Information only as required to comply with binding orders of governmental entities that have jurisdiction over it or as otherwise required by law; provided, however, Developer must: (a) give FLIR reasonable written notice to allow FLIR to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy (except to the extent Developer’s compliance with the foregoing would cause it to violate a court order or other legal requirement); (b) disclose only such portion of Confidential Information as is required by the governmental entity or otherwise required by law, and protect the remainder of the Confidential Information; and (c) at FLIR’s request and expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment (e.g., by protective order or equivalent) for any Confidential Information so disclosed.

7.	FEEDBACK.  Developer shall promptly report to FLIR all bugs, malfunctions or other defects discovered by Developer in connection with its use of the FLIR SDK, and Developer may further provide suggestions, comments or other feedback to FLIR based on such use of the FLIR SDK.  All information regarding any bugs, malfunctions or defects and all such suggestions, comments or other feedback provided by Developer hereunder are herein referred to as “Feedback.”  Developer acknowledges and agrees that FLIR shall be the sole and exclusive owner of all right, title and interest in the Feedback, including without limitation, all trade secrets, know-how, patents, copyrights or other Intellectual Property Rights embodied in the Feedback.  Developer intends that the Feedback, including any part thereof, be deemed “works made for hire” of which FLIR shall be deemed the author.  If for any reason any such Feedback is not deemed “works made for hire” or if for any reason ownership of the Feedback, including without limitation, all Intellectual Property Rights associated therewith, is not otherwise fully vested in FLIR as a result of such designation, Developer hereby irrevocably assigns to FLIR all of Developer’s right, title, and interest in and to any and all of such Feedback, whether arising from copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, or any other intellectual property law or doctrine.   If any right (including, without limitation, any moral right) in such Feedback cannot be assigned, Developer hereby waives enforcement anywhere in the world of such right against FLIR and exclusively and perpetually licenses such right to FLIR, its licensees, successors and assigns.

8.	EXPORT RESTRICTIONS; U.S. GOVERNMENT RIGHTS.  

8.1	Export Restrictions.  Developer acknowledges and agrees that the FLIR SDK may be subject to governmental export, import and/or use controls.  Developer shall not export, re-export, import, use or transfer the FLIR SDK except in compliance with the laws and regulations of the countries and/or territories from which the FLIR SDK is being exported or to which the FLIR SDK is being imported.  At a minimum, the FLIR SDK shall not be exported to: (i) any country subject to U.N. Security Council embargo or action; (ii) to countries subject to U.S. economic sanctions and embargoes; or (iii) to persons or entities prohibited from receiving U.S. exports or items or material originating from the U.S.

11.1	Term. 	This Agreement shall commence as of the date Developer signs the Agreement or clicks “I ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE” below (the “Effective Date”), whichever form of license is used, and shall continue until terminated in accordance with Section 11.2. 

11.2	Termination. 

(i)	This Agreement may be terminated by FLIR upon the breach by Developer of any other term, provision, covenant, representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement if the breach remains uncured for a period of ten (10) calendar days after the date FLIR provides notice thereof to Developer.

Neither this Agreement nor any interest herein is assignable by Developer without the prior written consent of FLIR.   The failure of any party hereto to insist upon strict performance of any provision of this Agreement or to exercise any right hereunder will not constitute a waiver of that provision or right. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to create an agency, joint venture or partnership relation between the parties hereto.  It is understood and agreed that Developer is not, by reason of this Agreement or anything herein contained, constituted or appointed the agent or representative of FLIR for any purpose whatsoever, nor shall anything herein contained be deemed or construed as granting to Developer any right or authority to assume or to create any obligation or responsibility for, on behalf of, or in the name of FLIR, or to bind FLIR in any way or manner whatsoever. This Agreement shall be controlled by and construed under the laws of the State of Oregon, USA (excluding its conflicts of laws principles) and not under the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of Goods.

          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or

          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The

          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.

            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

  b. ShareAlike.

     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.

       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
          license with the same License Elements, this version or
          later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.

       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
          context in which You Share Adapted Material.

       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,

     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
